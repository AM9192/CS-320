Ensuring that my code, program, or software is both functional and secure requires a combination of thorough testing, strong design principles, and adherence to best practices. Throughout this course, I used JUnit testing extensively to verify that my code met functional requirements and behaved as expected under different scenarios. For instance, when developing the Contact.java, Appointment.java, and Task.java classes, I created unit tests to check for valid input, prevent duplicate or incorrect data, and ensure that exceptions were properly handled. By implementing validation methods to enforce constraints—such as limiting the length of contact names or preventing null values in appointment dates—I maintained both functionality and data integrity. These practices helped ensure that my code was robust, reducing potential bugs and security risks.

Interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program required careful planning and iterative refinement. I approached this by designing flexible and scalable classes that could accommodate different user requirements while maintaining clarity and ease of use. For example, in the appointment scheduling system, I ensured that appointments could not be created with past dates, reflecting a real-world constraint that users would expect. Designing software involved breaking down functionality into clear, single-responsibility classes, which improved maintainability and readability. By leveraging object-oriented principles such as encapsulation and modularity, I was able to create programs that were both efficient and easy to extend. This structured approach allowed me to develop well-organized, testable, and reliable software solutions that met user needs effectively.
